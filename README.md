This is a 'choose your own adventure' of biblical punishment. It was originally inspired by the cyclical convergence of the passover festivities, in which the wrath of the Old Testament God is on display, and tax season, in which Turbo Tax takes me on a choose your own adventure through my W2 and the tax code. I combined the content of the first with the layout of the second, picturing myself as a hapless ancient Israelite with an internet connection.

This project is built in React. It takes a deeply nested hash of possible options and answers and traverses it based on the user's latest action. It also tracks the history of the user's options by inserting their choices into an array (see the userHistory array on the main App component) and using those choices as keys to traverse the original JSON content.
